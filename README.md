# valheimworlds

This repository is for sharing Valheim world files among friends so that players can play on friend-created worlds without needing their friends to be around to start the servers.

Locate your world files in this directory: `C*:\Users\[your username]\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds\`.

The `AppData` folder is normally invisible so you'll have to type it manually in the path URI.

Find the two files with the name of your server that have the **.db** and the **.fwl** extensions.

These are also the files belonging to your friends that you'll need to place in this folder.

Once done correctly you should be able to find your friend's server in the list of worlds to join in the game's main menu.
